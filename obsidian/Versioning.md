[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) is a way to define the increments and format in which a product's version number is changed

Given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, increment:
1. MAJOR when incompatible API changes are made
2. MINOR when functionality is added with backward compatibility
3. PATCH when a bug is fixed with backward compatibility
